# OVM KERNEL UPGRADE
Script which can be used to upgrade your Oracle VM Linux Kernel. 

The scripting will check if all available packages are in place to upgrade your Oracle VM server from a 2.6.39-300.32.6.el5uek Linux kernel to a 2.6.39-400.215.9.el5uek Linux kernel. The script can be used in situations where you have a disconnected OVM server (not connected to YUM) and you want to be sure you have everything in place to upgrade your kernel to the  2.6.39-400.215.9.el5uek kernel.
